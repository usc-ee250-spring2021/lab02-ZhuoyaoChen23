# Ultrasonic Sensor Client
# 
# This code runs on the Raspberry Pi. It should sit in a loop which reads from
# the Grove Ultrasonic Ranger and sends the reading to the Ultrasonic Sensor 
# Server running on your VM via UDP packets. 

import sys
# By appending the folder of all the GrovePi libraries to the system path here,
# we are able to successfully `import grovepi` below. You may need more for your
# assignment.
